# Overview

This dataset contains protein information sourced from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB).

The PDB archive serves as a comprehensive repository of atomic coordinates and related data that describe the structures of proteins and other essential biological macromolecules. Structural biologists employ techniques like X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy to map the positions of atoms within these molecules. Once determined, this structural information is submitted to the archive, where it is annotated and made publicly accessible by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB).

As the PDB continues to expand, it reflects the ongoing advancements in laboratories worldwide. While this growth offers exciting opportunities for research and education, it can also present challenges. The extensive database contains numerous variations of molecular structures, including multiple representations of the same molecule, partial structures, and modified or inactive forms. Navigating this wealth of information requires careful selection to ensure the data best suits your research needs.

# Content

There are two data files. Both are arranged on "structureId" of the protein:

## File 1
pdb_data_no_dups.csv contains protein meta data which includes details on protein classification, extraction methods, etc.

## File 2
data_seq.csv contains >400,000 protein structure sequences.
